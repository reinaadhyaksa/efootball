        question: "Is eFootball 2024 free to play?",
        answer: "Yes, eFootball 2024 is free to play with optional in-game purchases. You can download and play the base game without spending money, though some premium players and items require eFootball Coins (the premium currency)."
    },
    {
        question: "What's the difference between GP and Coins?",
        answer: "GP (Game Points) are earned by playing matches and completing objectives. They can be used to sign standard players and managers. Coins are the premium currency (purchased with real money or earned sparingly through events) used for special agents, iconic players, and other premium content."
    },
    {
        question: "How do I improve my team quickly?",
        answer: "Focus on completing all tutorials and beginner events first as they provide valuable rewards. Play against AI in lower divisions to build confidence and earn GP. Look for \"Featured Players\" in special agents that often have boosted stats. Most importantly, be patient - team building is a gradual process."
    },
    {
        question: "Why do my players feel slow compared to opponents?",
        answer: "Several factors affect player speed: 1) Player stats (especially speed and acceleration), 2) Team Spirit (chemistry), 3) Player stamina (check in-match fatigue), 4) Connection quality in online matches, and 5) Tactics (counter attack teams generally feel faster). Make sure to check these areas if your players feel sluggish."
    },
    {
        question: "How often does the game receive updates?",
        answer: "eFootball 2024 typically receives major updates every 2-3 months with new features and gameplay improvements. Data updates (player transfers, form updates) happen weekly. Special events and tournaments rotate more frequently, often weekly or bi-weekly. Follow the official eFootball channels or our website for update news."
